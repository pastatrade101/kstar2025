 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EduPro Hub
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset allows public read access for most content,

 * @dataStructure The database consists of several top-level collections.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Public collections (courses, instructors, etc.) are readable by anyone.
 *   - Write access to content collections (news_events) is restricted to authenticated users.
 *   - Contact submissions are publicly writable but only readable by authenticated users.
