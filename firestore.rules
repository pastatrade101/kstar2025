/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EduPro Hub.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access for all collections (courses, instructors, news_events, and admission_information) to allow for public consumption of data.
 * There is no authorization enforced based on user identity, so all users, including unauthenticated users, can freely access the data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Each entity (Course, Instructor, NewsEvent, AdmissionInformation) resides in its own top-level collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All read operations (get, list) are allowed for all users, including unauthenticated users, on all collections.
 * - No User-Based Authorization: The system does not currently implement user-specific roles or ownership.
 * - Unsecured Write Access: Write operations (create, update, delete) are blocked for all users.
