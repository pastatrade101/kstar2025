/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EduPro Hub
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset allows public read access for most content,
 *   while restricting write operations to authenticated administrators with an 'admin' role.
 * @dataStructure The database consists of several top-level collections.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Public collections (courses, instructors, etc.) are readable by anyone.
 *   - Write access to content collections is restricted to admins.
 *   - Contact submissions are publicly writable but only readable by admins.
 *   - Users can create their own user profile document, but cannot assign themselves as admin.
 *   - Job applications are stored in a subcollection under the user who created them. Admins can manage all applications.
